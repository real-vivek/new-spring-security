1.	First enter the URL(http://localhost:8080/accountInfo) in postman
2.	Select Authorization tab in postman and select Basic Authentication
3.	Enter Username(root) and Password(****) and send the request
4.	If the request is successful, in the response header we will get a header(Authorization) with JWT
5.	Copy that header value and for the next request select Authorization as Bearer Token in Postman's Authorization tab
6.	Paste the copied token value in the token input box and send the request to get Authenticated/Authorized using JWT
7.	Follow the same steps from step 4  for subsequent request
8.	To make sure that we are getting authenticated and authorized using jwt we can modify the token and confirm that we get error saying "org.springframework.security.authentication.BadCredentialsException: Invalid Token received"
